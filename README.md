# 🧠 Smart Reach — AI-Powered Campaign Intelligence

## 🚀 Mission

Empower marketers with a live cockpit to:
1. Monitor real-time engagement across channels.
2. Receive AI-derived next-best actions (NBAs) that optimize revenue, risk, and compliance.
3. Auto-generate channel-ready content variants with brand and legal guardrails.

## 💡 What It Does

### 📊 Engagement Telemetry
Track campaign reach, clicks, conversions, churn risk, LTV shifts, and cohort trends in real time.

### 🎯 Personalized Offer Propositions
Use behavioral, transactional, and preference data to recommend tailored products (e.g., credit cards, loans, insurance).

### 🧠 NBA Decisioning
For each user or segment, calculate the optimal action (offer, content, channel, time) with built-in constraints (frequency caps, eligibility, compliance).

### ✍️ Auto Content Generation
Generate brand-safe email, push, and social copy — versioned and A/B test-ready.

### 🔁 Closed-Loop Learning
Monitor uplift, learn via bandits or reinforcement learning, and auto-promote winning variants.

## 🧱 Architectural Blueprint

### 1️⃣ Data Layer
- **Sources**: CRM/CDP, clickstream, transactions, campaign logs.
- **Ingestion**: IBM Event Streams (Kafka) → watsonx.data (lakehouse) → Feature Store.

### 2️⃣ AI/ML Layer
- **Recommendation Models**: Next-best product/action.
- **Propensity Models**: Conversion, churn, engagement likelihood.
- **Generative AI**: Personalized content generation.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Anchors content in product terms, brand guidelines, and compliance policies.

### 3️⃣ Agentic AI Orchestration (via IBM watsonx.ai)
| Agent               | Role                                                                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Insights Agent**  | Monitors engagement and flags anomalies                              |
| **NBA Agent**       | Selects optimal offer/channel/time per user                          |
| **Content Agent**   | Generates and adapts creatives with RAG anchoring                    |
| **Compliance Agent**| Validates content against legal and frequency constraints            |
| **Experimentation Agent** | Executes A/B tests and auto-promotes winners                  |

### 4️⃣ Decision & Delivery Layer
- **NBA API**: Delivers recommendations to channels (email, app, ads).
- **Content API**: Offers ready-to-publish creatives.
- **Channel Connectors**: ESPs, push services, social APIs.

### 5️⃣ Dashboard/UI
- Engagement visualizations (funnels, cohorts, heatmaps).
- User 360 profiles with explainable NBA logic.
- Content workbench (generate → review → approve).
- Governance view (approvals, compliance logs).

## 🤖 Role of Generative AI

### ✍️ Grounded Content Generation
Produce email, push, and social posts conditioned on persona, product, and compliance snippets via RAG. Deliver multiple tones, lengths, and UTM-tagged CTAs.

### 📣 Decision Support Narration
Translate model outputs into plain-language insights:
> “This user has a 72% chance of accepting a rewards card; try a low-fee variation through push during 6–8 pm.”

### 🧭 Journey Ideation
Propose micro-journeys and multistep sequences. Auto-draft subject lines and push titles from successful patterns.

### 📊 Analyst Copilot
Convert SQL to insight for marketers. Enable rapid cohort comparisons and anomaly summaries.
